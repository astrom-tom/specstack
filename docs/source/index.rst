**Contribute!**
specstack is not perfect! It has been primarily developed for my private research and I decided to release i
n the spirit of making the research process as transparent as possible and in the hope it can be used by
other people. If you have any comment or anything you would like to be added to specstack, or, even better,
if you want to modify it, you can either do it yourself or please feel free to contact me! ---> **rthomas@eso.org, the.spartan.proj@gmail.com**. In any case, you can find the source code `here <https://github.com/astrom-tom/specstack>`_.
